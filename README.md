# AlliGator-Plugin-Template
Template repository for AlliGator Python plugin

If possible, name your repository "AlliGator-Plugin-my-plugin-name" in order for 
it to be easily searchable on GitHub.

An AlliGator Python Plugin repository should contain at least 3 mandatory files:

+ A Python script (*.py file) containing the function(s) to be called by 
AlliGator. This script/function(s) should comply with the API as described in 
AlliGator's [manual page](https://alligator-distribution.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alligator-python-plugins.html).

+ A license.txt file (the default license is BSD 3-Clause) with the correct 
copyright holder name and date

+ A Readme.md file (this file) modified to be relevant to your plugin (in particular,
the current content should be removed and replaced by your own content). The role
of the Readme.md file is to provide basic information on the plugin and preferably
enough information on how to use it. Instructions on how to use the plugin, or 
links to a website/URL providing these instructions would belong to the Readme 
file. A simple guide to the markup language used in *.md file can be found 
[here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

If possible, provide files to test the plugin in a *data* folder within the 
repository, and if appropriate, results from the analysis (e.g. screenshot of 
outputs, AlliGator notebook, plot files, etc.) in a *results* folder.

It is recommended to store images used to illustrate the Readme file in an 
*images* folder in the repository.
