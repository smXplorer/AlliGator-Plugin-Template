# AlliGator-Plugin-Template
Template repository for AlliGator Python plugin

An AlliGator Python Plugin repository should contain at least:

+ A Python script (*.py file) containing the function(s) to be called by 
AlliGator. This script/function(s) should comply with the API as described in 
AlliGator's `manual page <https://alligator-distribution.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alligator-python-plugins.html>`_

+ A license.txt file (the default license is BSD 3-Clause) with the correct 
copyright holder name and date

+ A Readme.md file (this file) modified to be relevant to your plugin (in particular,
the current content should be removed and replaced by your own content). The role
of the Readme.md file is to provide basic information on the plugin and preferably
enough information on how to use it.
